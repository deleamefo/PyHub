# Naming conventions


# 1. Most variables should be snake_case (underscores between words)
# 2. Most variable should be lowercase, with some exceptions: CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE usually refers to constants (e.g PI = 3.14)
# 3. Most UpperCamelCase usually refers to a class
# 4. Variables that start and end with two underscores(called "dunder" for double underscore) are supposed to be private or left alone. Example: __no_touchy__
# 5


# Data Types

# bool: on or off, true or false, 0 or 1,
# Dynamic Typing

# Python uses dynamic typing, since its variables can change types readily.

# Example below:

awesomeness = True
print(awesomeness)  # true

# Special variable : NONE
# None is to represent the ideal of nothingness

# Declaring String
